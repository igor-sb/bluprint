Contributing code guidelines
----------------------------

1. Clone the repo.
2. Ensure you have a development environment setup. This includes correct versions of Python, PDM as well as R and it's relevant packages if you intend to change R project code. Run ``pdm install --dev`` to install all dependencies, including those in the development group in *pyproject.toml*.
3. After creating a new code, ensure it passes linting and static typing checks; run ``make lint``.
4. Add appropriate unit tests and ensure it passes all unit tests; run ``make test``.
5. If you make changes to the documentation, you can build it locally using ``make docs``, then open *docs/build/index.html* file in your browser.
6. If everything passes correctly, update the Bluprint version in *pyproject.toml*.
7. Push the changes to Github.
8. Open a PR.
