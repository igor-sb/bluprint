Getting started with bluprint
=============================

Python-only projects
--------------------

Create a new directory ``myproj`` with the project template:

.. code-block:: bash

	bluprint create myproj




Python/R projects
-----------------

or if you would like to setup a Python/R project:

.. code-block:: bash

	bluprint create myproj -r

which also installs renv. To get started with RStudio, load the .Rproj file which also sets up project root directory as a working directory in R session.
