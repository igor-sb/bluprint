* Fully portable projects: copy or move the project folder anywhere

* Configuration and data paths organized in YAML files

* Project-specific code easily importable into notebooks:
  ``from myproject import function``

* Quickly check all notebook cells can be executed in order

* Setup simple notebook workflows through YAML
