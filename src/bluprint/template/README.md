Project description.

## Installation

Install [PDM](https://pdm-project.org), then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/{{git_account_name}}/placeholder_name.git
cd placeholder_name
pdm install
```

## Running notebooks

Open and run a notebook in your IDE of choice (VSCode, Jupyter, ...). Make sure
to select the correct kernel, which should point to the `.venv` virtual
environment inside this directory. In VSCode it will show as `.venv/bin/python`
and should be marked as "Recommended".
